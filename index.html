            <h2>Short Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Dylan and I'm 17 years old, I've lived in Port Orchard, Washington for my whole life and I've always been interested in computers, how they work, and how software is developed. I graduated highschool a year ahead of my class through online schooling so I could pursue my career and get a head start.</p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/Port_Orchard_WA%2C_October_2015.jpg/1200px-Port_Orchard_WA%2C_October_2015.jpg" width="600" height=auto alt="Downtown PO">

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I just recently graduated highschool so my education history consists of only a diploma. I knew I wouldn't need a college degree to make it in tech, so I looked around and found codefellows would be my best option.</p> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2684/1*MghnV-Q6kiAeO-ZQQreitA.png" width="600" height="auto" alt="CodeFellows">

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I've only ever had one job that I got when I was 16. I worked as a cart boy (outside services) at a golf course in Bremerton for 2 years and just recently quit to persue education and a career in software development.</p> <img src="https://golfadvisor.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b150418/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x3096+0+180/resize/1440x860!/format/jpg/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgolfadvisor.brightspotcdn.com%2Fa1%2F82%2F37406749324cd7f133aaced9ae67%2Fp.php" width="600" height="auto" alt="GoldMountain">
